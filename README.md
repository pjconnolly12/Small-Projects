# Small-Projects
For small practice projects to help me improve my coding

* **A Dice Roll simulator** - pretty basic code
* **FizzBuzz** - gotta know it 
* **Year 100** - just tells you what year it will be when you turn 100
* **Odd or Even** - basic challenge to work on basic concepts
* **Fibonacci** - couple ways to solve the fibonacci equation
* **Girls Baby Name Generator** _using bs4_ (my first time using that framework)
