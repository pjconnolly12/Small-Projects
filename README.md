# Small-Projects
For small practice projects to help me improve

1) a Dice Roll simulator - pretty basic code
2) FizzBuzz - gotta know it 
3) Year 100 - just tells you what year it will be when you turn 100
4) Odd or Even - basic challenge to work on basic concepts
5) Fibonacci - couple ways to solve the fibonacci equation
6) girls baby name generator using bs4 (my first time using that framework)
